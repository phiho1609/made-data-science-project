# Unpunctuality Tolerance of Schleswig-Holstein

## Motivation
Unfortunately the german leader in railway transport, Deutsche Bahn, is infamous for its lack in punctuality. But to what level does this lead to the german population switching from public transportation, or trains of the Deutsche Bahn, to be more precise, to travel with a car instead? This project shall give insights into this question, by trying to correlate unpunctuality of trains and the amount of street traffic in the german federal state of Schleswig-Holstein.
